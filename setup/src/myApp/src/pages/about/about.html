    This is a test application developed for CDAC Project. 
</p>
<p>
As having an Embedded Engineering background we had very little knowledge about App building or server maintainance or database management. This was just a attempt to make something different. For building this app we used <a href="https://github.com/Appiko/cross-platform-apps">Appiko's codebase</a>
 </p>
 <p>
All the technology developed by Appiko is free and open source.
